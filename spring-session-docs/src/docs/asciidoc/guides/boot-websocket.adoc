This guide describes how to use Spring Session to ensure that WebSocket messages keep your HttpSession alive.

// tag::disclaimer[]

NOTE: Spring Session's WebSocket support works only with Spring's WebSocket support.
Specifically,it does not work with using https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=356[JSR-356] directly, because JSR-356 does not have a mechanism for intercepting incoming WebSocket messages.

== HttpSession Setup

The first step is to integrate Spring Session with the HttpSession. These steps are already outlined in the link:./boot-redis.html[HttpSession with Redis Guide].

Please make sure you have already integrated Spring Session with HttpSession before proceeding.

== Spring Configuration

In a typical Spring WebSocket application, you would implement `WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer`.
For example, the configuration might look something like the following:

====
[source,java]
----
include::{websocketdoc-test-dir}WebSocketConfig.java[tags=class]
----
====

We can update our configuration to use Spring Session's WebSocket support.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
.src/main/java/samples/config/WebSocketConfig.java
[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}spring-session-sample-boot-websocket/src/main/java/sample/config/WebSocketConfig.java[tags=class]
----

To hook in the Spring Session support we only need to change two things:

<1> Instead of implementing `WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer`, we extend `AbstractSessionWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer`
<2> We rename the `registerStompEndpoints` method to `configureStompEndpoints`
====

What does `AbstractSessionWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer` do behind the scenes?

* `WebSocketConnectHandlerDecoratorFactory` is added as a `WebSocketHandlerDecoratorFactory` to `WebSocketTransportRegistration`.
This ensures a custom `SessionConnectEvent` is fired that contains the `WebSocketSession`.
The `WebSocketSession` is necessary to terminate any WebSocket connections that are still open when a Spring Session is terminated.
* `SessionRepositoryMessageInterceptor` is added as a `HandshakeInterceptor` to every `StompWebSocketEndpointRegistration`.
This ensures that the `Session` is added to the WebSocket properties to enable updating the last accessed time.
* `SessionRepositoryMessageInterceptor` is added as a `ChannelInterceptor` to our inbound `ChannelRegistration`.
This ensures that every time an inbound message is received, that the last accessed time of our Spring Session is updated.
* `WebSocketRegistryListener` is created as a Spring bean.
This ensures that we have a mapping of all of the `Session` IDs to the corresponding WebSocket connections.
By maintaining this mapping, we can close all the WebSocket connections when a Spring Session (HttpSession) is terminated.

[[websocket-sample]]
== `websocket` Sample Application

The `websocket` sample application demonstrates how to use Spring Session with WebSockets.

=== Running the `websocket` Sample Application

You can run the sample by obtaining the {download-url}[source code] and invoking the following command:

====
----
$ ./gradlew :spring-session-sample-boot-websocket:bootRun
----
====

[TIP]
=====
For the purposes of testing session expiration, you may want to change the session expiration to be 1 minute (the default is 30 minutes) by adding the following configuration property before starting the application:

====
.src/main/resources/application.properties
----
server.servlet.session.timeout=1m # Session timeout. If a duration suffix is not specified, seconds will be used.
----
====
=====

NOTE: For the sample to work, you must https://redis.io/download[install Redis 2.8+] on localhost and run it with the default port (6379).
Alternatively, you can update the `RedisConnectionFactory` to point to a Redis server.
Another option is to use https://www.docker.com/[Docker] to run Redis on localhost.
See https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/[Docker Redis repository] for detailed instructions.

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:8080/

=== Exploring the `websocket` Sample Application

Now you can try using the application. Authenticate with the following information:

* *Username* _rob_
* *Password* _password_

Now click the *Login* button. You should now be authenticated as the user **rob**.

Open an incognito window and access http://localhost:8080/

You are prompted with a login form. Authenticate with the following information:

* *Username* _luke_
* *Password* _password_

Now send a message from rob to luke. The message should appear.

Wait for two minutes and try sending a message from rob to luke again.
You can see that the message is no longer sent.

[NOTE]
.Why two minutes?
====
Spring Session expires in 60 seconds, but the notification from Redis is not guaranteed to happen within 60 seconds.
To ensure the socket is closed in a reasonable amount of time, Spring Session runs a background task every minute at 00 seconds that forcibly cleans up any expired sessions.
This means you need to wait at most two minutes before the WebSocket connection is terminated.
====

You can now try accessing http://localhost:8080/
You are prompted to authenticate again.
This demonstrates that the session properly expires.

Now repeat the same exercise, but instead of waiting two minutes, send a message from each of the users every 30 seconds.
You can see that the messages continue to be sent.
Try accessing http://localhost:8080/
You are not prompted to authenticate again.
This demonstrates the session is kept alive.

NOTE: Only messages sent from a user keep the session alive.
This is because only messages coming from a user imply user activity.
Received messages do not imply activity and, thus, do not renew the session expiration.
