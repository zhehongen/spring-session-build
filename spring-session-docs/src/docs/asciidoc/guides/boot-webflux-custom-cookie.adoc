This guide describes how to configure Spring Session to use custom cookies in a WebFlux based application.
The guide assumes you have already set up Spring Session in your project using your chosen data store. For example, link:./boot-redis.html[HttpSession with Redis].

NOTE: You can find the completed guide in the <<webflux-custom-cookie-sample, WebFlux Custom Cookie sample application>>.

== Spring Boot Configuration

Once you have set up Spring Session, you can customize how the session cookie is written by exposing a `WebSessionIdResolver` as a Spring bean.
Spring Session uses a `CookieWebSessionIdResolver` by default.
Exposing the `WebSessionIdResolver` as a Spring bean augments the existing configuration when you use configurations like `@EnableRedisHttpSession`.
The following example shows how to customize Spring Session's cookie:

====
[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}spring-session-sample-boot-webflux-custom-cookie/src/main/java/sample/CookieConfig.java[tags=webflux-cookie-serializer]
----

<1> We customize the name of the cookie to be `JSESSIONID`.
<2> We customize the path of the cookie to be `/` (rather than the default of the context root).
<3> We customize the `SameSite` cookie directive to be `Strict`.

== `webflux-custom-cookie` Sample Application

This section describes how to work with the `webflux-custom-cookie` sample application.

=== Running the `webflux-custom-cookie` Sample Application

You can run the sample by obtaining the {download-url}[source code] and invoking the following command:

====
----
$ ./gradlew :spring-session-sample-boot-webflux-custom-cookie:bootRun
----
====

NOTE: For the sample to work, you must https://redis.io/download[install Redis 2.8+] on localhost and run it with the default port (6379).
Alternatively, you can update the `RedisConnectionFactory` to point to a Redis server.
Another option is to use https://www.docker.com/[Docker] to run Redis on localhost. See https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/[Docker Redis repository] for detailed instructions.

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:8080/

=== Exploring the `webflux-custom-cookie` Sample Application

Now you can use the application. Fill out the form with the following information:

* *Attribute Name:* _username_
* *Attribute Value:* _rob_

Now click the *Set Attribute* button.
You should now see the values displayed in the table.

If you look at the cookies for the application, you can see the cookie is saved to the custom name of `JSESSIONID`.
