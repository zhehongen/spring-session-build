Spring Session provides an API and implementations for managing a user's session information, while also making it trivial to support clustered sessions without being tied to an application container specific solution.
It also provides transparent integration with:

* `HttpSession` - allows replacing the `HttpSession` in an application container (i.e. Tomcat) neutral way, with support for providing session IDs in headers to work with RESTful APIs.
* `WebSocket` - provides the ability to keep the `HttpSession` alive when receiving WebSocket messages
* `WebSession` - allows replacing the Spring WebFlux's `WebSession` in an application container neutral way.

== Modules

Spring Session consists of the following modules:

* Spring Session Core - provides core Spring Session functionalities and APIs
* Spring Session Data Redis - provides `SessionRepository` and `ReactiveSessionRepository` implementation backed by Redis and configuration support
* Spring Session JDBC - provides `SessionRepository` implementation backed by a relational database and configuration support
* Spring Session Hazelcast - provides `SessionRepository` implementation backed by Hazelcast and configuration support
